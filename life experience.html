        HELLO!
        This is a little insight to myself as a person. Aspects of being "Alejandro Lijo" include being an uncle, a brother, a student, a worker,
        and a son.
        I am a very outgoing person whenever I am comfortable with someone. I am always willing to help which I think is an important
        quality that all people should have because everyone needs a little bit of help here and there.
        My entire family is from Spain and I was the only one that was actually born in the United States. Like most
        immigrant families, my parents came here for a better life and have been working hard ever since, which is where
        I get my work ethic from. I tend to remain calm in time that I need to remain calm. This is definitely due to the
        jobs that I have had over the course of the last couple of years. Since I was 16, I have worked at a funeral
        home as the doorman and just a general worker there. Whenever my boss, Mark, needs me, I go in and help with whatever
        I can, whether that be technical issues, translating for spanish funerals, or shoveling snow the night of a wake.
        Aside from that, I have also worked over the summer at a cemetery cutting grass,  at a medical billing company called
        PGM, and at a trucking company called NEMF in the overnight billing department. I have been working since I was 16,
        and haven't had a summer off since. But all fun and no play makes Alejandro a tired zombie. So I have hobbies and
        interests such as traveling and kayaking that I absolutely enjoy.
    </p>
